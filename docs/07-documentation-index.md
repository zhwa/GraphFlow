## 🚀 Quick Reference

### Essential Code Patterns

**Basic Agent Structure:**
```python
from graphflow import StateGraph, Command, END

def process_data(state):
    return {"data": f"Processed: {state['data']}"}

# Create initial state
initial_state = {"data": "", "step": 0}

graph = StateGraph()
graph.add_node("process", process_data)
graph.set_entry_point("process")
app = graph.compile()
```

**Command-Based Routing:**
```python
def smart_router(state: MyState) -> Command:
    if state["step"] > 5:
        return Command(update={"done": True}, goto=END)
    else:
        return Command(
            update={"step": state["step"] + 1}, 
            goto="continue_processing"
        )
```

**Conditional Flow:**
```python
def route_by_condition(state: MyState) -> str:
    return "path_a" if state["data"] else "path_b"

graph.add_conditional_edges("router", route_by_condition)
```
