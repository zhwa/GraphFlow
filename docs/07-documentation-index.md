## üöÄ Quick Reference

### Essential Code Patterns

**Basic Agent Structure:**
```python
from graphflow import StateGraph, Command, END
from typing import TypedDict

class MyState(TypedDict):
    data: str
    step: int

def process_data(state: MyState) -> dict:
    return {"data": f"Processed: {state['data']}"}

graph = StateGraph(MyState)
graph.add_node("process", process_data)
graph.set_entry_point("process")
app = graph.compile()
```

**Command-Based Routing:**
```python
def smart_router(state: MyState) -> Command:
    if state["step"] > 5:
        return Command(update={"done": True}, goto=END)
    else:
        return Command(
            update={"step": state["step"] + 1}, 
            goto="continue_processing"
        )
```

**Conditional Flow:**
```python
def route_by_condition(state: MyState) -> str:
    return "path_a" if state["data"] else "path_b"

graph.add_conditional_edges("router", route_by_condition)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Learn

By working through this documentation, you'll master:

- **State-based architecture** - How to design data-driven workflows

## üí° Key Principles

GraphFlow is built on these core principles that you'll see throughout:

1. **Simplicity First** - Complex systems built from simple parts
2. **State-Centric** - Everything revolves around shared state
3. **Function-Based** - Pure functions for predictable behavior
4. **Type Safety** - TypedDict for development-time error catching
5. **Zero Dependencies** - No external requirements for core functionality
6. **LangGraph Compatible** - Familiar API for easy migration
