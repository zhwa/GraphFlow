# GraphFlow vs LangGraph: Feature Comparison

## Overview

This document compares **GraphFlow** (our LangGraph-like framework built on PocketFlow) with **LangGraph** to help you choose the right tool for your project.

## Key Differences Summary

| Aspect | GraphFlow | LangGraph |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Philosophy** | Minimalist, focused on core functionality | Feature-rich, comprehensive framework |
| **Dependencies** | PocketFlow only (embedded) | LangChain + many extras |
| **Learning Curve** | Low - simple API | Medium-High - many concepts |
| **Performance** | Lightweight, fast startup | Heavier due to dependencies |
| **Code Size** | ~500 lines total | Thousands of lines |
| **Maintenance** | Simple, easy to understand | Complex, many moving parts |

## Code Examples Comparison

### Simple Chat Agent

#### GraphFlow
```python
from graphflow import StateGraph, Command, END
from typing import TypedDict, List

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: List[str]
    user_input: str

def chat_node(state: State) -> Command:
    response = f"You said: {state['user_input']}"
    
    if "bye" in state["user_input"].lower():
        return Command(
            update={"messages": state["messages"] + [response]},
            goto=END
        )
    else:
        return Command(
            update={"messages": state["messages"] + [response]},
            goto="chat_node"
        )

graph = StateGraph(State)
graph.add_node("chat_node", chat_node)
graph.set_entry_point("chat_node")
compiled = graph.compile()
```

#### LangGraph
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.types import Command
from typing import TypedDict, List
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: List[HumanMessage | AIMessage]

def chat_node(state: State) -> Command:
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    response = AIMessage(content=f"You said: {last_message.content}")
    
    if "bye" in last_message.content.lower():
        return Command(
            update={"messages": [response]},
            goto=END
        )
    else:
        return Command(
            update={"messages": [response]},
            goto="chat_node"
        )

graph = StateGraph(State)
graph.add_node("chat_node", chat_node)
graph.add_edge(START, "chat_node")
compiled = graph.compile()
```

### Conditional Routing

#### GraphFlow
```python
def route_by_intent(state: State) -> str:
    if "weather" in state["user_input"].lower():
        return "weather_handler"
    elif "time" in state["user_input"].lower():
        return "time_handler"
    else:
        return "general_handler"

graph.add_conditional_edges("analyzer", route_by_intent)
```

#### LangGraph
```python
from typing import Literal

def route_by_intent(state: State) -> Literal["weather_handler", "time_handler", "general_handler"]:
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    if "weather" in last_message.content.lower():
        return "weather_handler"
    elif "time" in last_message.content.lower():
        return "time_handler"
    else:
        return "general_handler"

graph.add_conditional_edges("analyzer", route_by_intent)
```
