## Framework Features Achieved

### ✅ Core LangGraph Concepts Implemented
1. **StateGraph**: Main orchestrator class
2. **State Management**: TypedDict-based shared state
3. **Node Functions**: Python functions that read/write state
4. **Conditional Edges**: Dynamic routing based on state
5. **Command Objects**: Combine updates with routing
6. **Graph Compilation**: Validation and execution prep
7. **Direct Edges**: Simple node-to-node connections
8. **Entry Points**: Configurable starting nodes
9. **END Nodes**: Proper termination handling

### ✅ PocketFlow Integration
1. **Base Classes**: Built on PocketFlow's Node/Flow foundation
2. **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry with configurable parameters
3. **Async Support**: Full async/await from PocketFlow
4. **Error Handling**: Fallback mechanisms included
5. **Lightweight**: Maintains PocketFlow's minimal footprint

## Code Quality Metrics

- **Total Lines**: ~500 lines for complete framework
- **Dependencies**: Zero external dependencies (PocketFlow embedded)
- **Test Coverage**: All major features tested
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive with examples
- **Performance**: Fast startup, minimal memory usage

## Usage Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Simple Sequential Processing
```python
graph = StateGraph(State)
graph.add_node("process", process_func)
graph.set_entry_point("process")
```

### 2. Conditional Branching
```python
graph.add_conditional_edges("analyzer", route_func)
```

### 3. State Updates with Routing
```python
def node(state) -> Command:
    return Command(update={...}, goto="next_node")
```

### 4. Agent-like Workflows
```python
# Think -> Act -> Observe patterns
graph.add_edge("think", "act")
graph.add_conditional_edges("act", should_continue)
```
